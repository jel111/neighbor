								<h3>What is it?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Neighbor Sit is a web site and companion app that wants to bring back a sense of community. In the last few decades
								we have seen a shift away from the Neghborhoods where everyone knew and helped each other. In these days of a "Worldwide"
								community we have lost our neighborhoods that are physically right next door. Let's bring that back together!</p>

								<h3>What are our goals?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Our Goals are to bring our communities back together again, like it used to be. Like back in the day when people waved
								hi to each other and knew each others kids. When we could call a neighbor and not feel "Weird" to ask them to watch
								Johnny for an hour. We have fallen out of touch to feel comfortable enough to ask that question.</p>

							<h3>A great idea!</h3>
							<p>I can't remember how many people I have talked to about Neighborsit and they have all said they love this idea. Sure,
								there are some that say it will be hard to pull off and we can't take on Facebook but we are not trying to take on
								Facebook. We are trying to make a different app that helps us believe in community again. With all this technology
								we have and all the opportunity to have it work for <em><strong>us</strong></em> and not just sell us stuff/junk
								we do not need.</p>

							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/NSSlider03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h3>How we plan to develop NeighborSit</h3>
							<p>We have currently moved into the developement phase of our favorite APP/Website. Up until now it has all been talk
								and writing in my notebook. In other words just wishful thinking. Many months of planning and design has gone into
								this. We have been trying to figure out the what and how is the best way to go about making an App and companion
								site of this magnitude. After much discussion and research we think we are ready to take this head on and move into
								the developement stage. We are ready to take this off the written page and move into a pixel!</p>
							<p>I would be lying if ai said this wasn't scary. It is all that and more. To try and take ones idea and "pipe dream",
								according to some, and make it a reality. To invest a ton of time and resources and take this risk is no easy task.
								We feel that this is a great idea and the time is right to take our neighborhoods bak from the interweb. We want
								that feeling of security and safety when we go home. Isn't that what home means? A santuary of security, comfort
								food and friends, of Neighbors. Let's bring back those good ol' days! Please help us take on the internet and get
								our neighbors back. Don't forget to sign up and we will email you updates as we progress.</p>

										<p>This App idea came about out of a neccessity and to cure the problem of babysitting. Why is it always such a big

											that will make us even happier. Please sign up and help us!
